                                        Abhyanga — Traditional Ayurvedic oil massage. This 60 minute treatment stimulates the mind and body, cascading the skin to new levels of vitality via increased circulation and lymphatic drainage. The term "Abhyanga" translates to 'massaging the body with oil', highlighting how deeply rooted it is in ancient Ayurvedic traditions. The oils used are specific to your dosha (Vata, Pitta or Kapha) so it aligns with what is required by your body type.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In an Abhyanga treatment, oils are liberally applied and worked into the skin using long rhythmic strokes. This not only helps to feed the skin making it soft and supple but also aids in stimulating your lymphatic system. Abhyanga improves lymphatic circulation which promotes the elimination of waste products from the tissue to maintain body homeostasis. As Abhyanga helps in detoxification, it therefore also improves digestion, enhances immunity and holds the state of mind well balanced.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It also has a balancing effect on the doshas which is like this constitution of our body i,e these energies that govern physical and mental processes. When the doshas are in their balanced states, we experience good health, vitality and mental clarity. Abhyanga brings balance to this force by calming the nervous system, promoting stress (and consequently cortisol) reduction and supporting deep relaxation. Ongoing sessions can promote better sleep, less anxiety and an overall sense of contentment.
                                    </p>

                                        Patra Potli is the very effective treatment modality in Ayurveda that provide relief to all musculo-skeletal condition with combining goodness of heat & herbs. Patra means leaves, and potli refers to a poultice: the nerve is therapy implies essentially herbal leaves are filled into that tiny pouch. Patra Potli can be left on the painful spot for 15-20 minutes and is said to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic herbs. First, these herbs are heated and then made into a pouch or 'Potli' using cloth.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The heated Potli is applied to the area affected eg., back, neck, shoulders or joints during treatment. The Potli is warm which helps in the herbs releasing their medicinal properties deep into tissues getting relief from pain & stiffness. This treatment is a boon for arthritis, muscle spasm, and joint pains. In addition to the warmth (which is soothing for sore muscles), it helps stimulate circulation and improves your body's ability to heal.
                                    </p>

                                        Inflammation is a primary cause of pain and discomfort in the body, while Patra Potli helps greatly reduce inflammation. Inflammation of the tissues can be addressed by this treatment providing relief from pain, helping you to move and perform daily activities normally.

                                        This special and soothing Ayurvedic therapy can help people to relieve stress from migraine or all related disorders. Takradhara is a parent word in which "Kad" stands for butter milk flow. Medicated streams of buttermilk are gently poured over the forehead in a continuous flow similar to that used with Shirodhara treatment, except it uses buttermilk instead of oil.

                                        The buttermilk used in Takradhara is medicated with cooling herbs and it works well for conditions exacerbated by heat (migraines, skin problems/ excess Pitta), as the main ingredient of amalaki can reduce aggravation from an unstable fire. The chill of the buttermilk also calms down your scalp and mind, you will feel light, relieve from tension almost immediately and very clear-headed! The oil helps nourish hair and scalp, preventing dandruff and falling of hair.

                                        If you suffer from acute and frequent headaches or migraines, then this Ayurvedic takradhara therapy is especially good for calming the mind.

                                        Vasti, also known as Basti or simply put Vedic enema therapy which is regarded as the “King of Treatments” in Ayurveda. A powerful method of detoxification which involves the administration of herbal oils or decoctions into the colon. Regular Vasti is very high to rejuvenate the body by extracting deep-seated toxins, balance three doshas and reduce overall digestive power.

                                        The treatment starts with a herbal drink prepared specially for your dosha as well as the health requirements. This combination is then gently introduced into the colon, where they break up and remove toxins that have been built up over years. Since the colon is connected with all organs and tissues, this profound effect seen via Vasti yields to several other benefits which come from proper functioning digestive system.

                                        Vasti is particularly useful for individuals with complaints like constipation, arthritis and even lower backache etc. as these conditions are mostly oriented in nature. The therapy also aids in tissue rejuvenation and boosts the immune system, so as to better nutrient absorption which make it a holistic treatment towards long-term health. Vasti is able to relieve low energy, fogginess of mind and sense organ response with just a combination of regular treatments.

Anyone who wishes to improve the natural glisten of their skin and get a clean, starry complexion can opt for this therapy rather than using synthetic chemicals.

                                        This process is preceded by face cleansing involving mild scrubbing to cleanse the impurities followed by application of herbal paste for 10 mins. This paste is then applied onto the face and after it dries, it cleans out pores making way for acne to go reduced, also while conditioning skin. Ayurvedic ingredients present in the paste also helps to maintain natural hydration of skin, making it softer, and supple. For instance, turmeric is anti-inflammatory also reducing redness and irritation as sandalwood soothes the skin providing a cooling effect.
