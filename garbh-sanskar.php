                    Garbh Sanskar is an ancient Ayurvedic practice, a set of practices carried out by parents before conception or during pregnancy that are believed to affect the physical, mental and spiritual blossoming of an unborn child. Although science is still emerging, there are a few studies and observations of Garbha Sanskar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Provides Better Cognitive Performance:</b> It is said that prenatal stimulation of the foetus such as listening to music or positive affirmations can improve brain development and also help in better cognitive function. This, in turn can improve memory and learning of the baby
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Mental Health of the Mother:</b> As Ancient Indian practices like meditation, yoga and positive thinking are actively addressed in Garbh Sanskar concepts thus related research are common with Ayurveda claiming that many mental health conditions can be treated much better when we treat them with Garbha sanskar. This reduced stress can result in better pregnancies and fewer complications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Stronger Maternal- Fetal Bonding:</b> Doing activities that strengthens the emotional bonding of mother with child and Vice-versa. Researchers think bonding behaviors can help humans feel more attached after birth, and in creating a nurturing environment for the baby.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Healthier Pregnancy Outcomes:</b> By having a balanced diet and selective use of certain herbs as prescribed in Garbh Sanskar, pregnant women might have an overall better health which could lead to smooth deliveries with appropriate birth weights.
